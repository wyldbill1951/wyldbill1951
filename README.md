I love the program op25. I partitioned my drive and install DragonOS and got op25 working with talkgroups showing and blacklist blocking groups that are not in my city. the program works perfectly. the only problem I have is when I hit plot in the gnuradio it doesn't pop on screen it just starts filling my terminal with garbage characters. I just installed focal r22 and am glad to see my wireless disconnect problem is gone.
